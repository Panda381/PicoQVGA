 * Low level flash programming and erase API
 *
 * Note these functions are *unsafe* if you have two cores concurrently
 * executing from flash. In this case you must perform your own
 * synchronisation to make sure no XIP accesses take place during flash
 * programming.
 *
 * Likewise they are *unsafe* if you have interrupt handlers or an interrupt
 * vector table in flash, so you must disable interrupts before calling in
 * this case.
 *
 * If PICO_NO_FLASH=1 is not defined (i.e. if the program is built to run from
 * flash) then these functions will make a static copy of the second stage
 * bootloader in SRAM, and use this to reenter execute-in-place mode after
 * programming or erasing flash, so that they can safely be called from
 * flash-resident code.
